# extract-text-from-pdf-line-by-line-using-nodejs
Use npm and node to extract text line by line from pdf file.    

Technically this doesn't extract the text "line by line", but 
visually speaking, it does the same thing.  I wanted to make
it clear that this doesn't just output a big blob of text.

Just putting up an example for reference.

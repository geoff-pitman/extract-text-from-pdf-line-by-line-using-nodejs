                  This document illustrates several features of the Pdf995 Suite of Products.
,     Introduction
 The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) is a language for describing multi-
 participant interactive simulations -- virtual worlds networked via the global Internet and
 hyperlinked with the World Wide Web. All aspects of virtual world display, interaction
 and internetworking can be specified using VRML. It is the intention of its designers that




       D
 VRML become the standard language for interactive simulation within the World Wide
 Web.

 The first version of VRML allows for the creation of virtual worlds with limited



     VE
 interactive behavior. These worlds can contain objects which have hyperlinks to other
 worlds, HTML documents or other valid MIME types. When the user selects an object
 with a hyperlink, the appropriate MIME viewer is launched. When the user selects a link
 to a VRML document from within a correctly configured WWW browser, a VRML
 viewer is launched. Thus VRML viewers are the perfect companion applications to
 standard WWW browsers for navigating and visualizing the Web. Future versions of
    O
 VRML will allow for richer behaviors, including animations, motion physics and real-
 time multi-user interaction.

 This document specifies the features and syntax of Version 1.0 of VRML.

    VRML Mission Statement
 PP


 The history of the development of the Internet has had three distinct phases; first, the
 development of the TCP/IP infrastructure which allowed documents and data to be stored
 in a proximally independent way; that is, Internet provided a layer of abstraction between
 data sets and the hosts which manipulated them. While this abstraction was useful, it was
 also confusing; without any clear sense of "what went where", access to Internet was
 restricted to the class of sysops/net surfers who could maintain internal cognitive maps of
 the data space.
A




 Next, Tim Berners-Lee’s work at CERN, where he developed the hypermedia system
 known as World Wide Web, added another layer of abstraction to the existing structure.
 This abstraction provided an "addressing" scheme, a unique identifier (the Universal
 Resource Locator), which could tell anyone "where to go and how to get there" for any
 piece of data within the Web. While useful, it lacked dimensionality; there’s no there
 there within the web, and the only type of navigation permissible (other than surfing) is
 by direct reference. In other words, I can only tell you how to get to the VRML Forum
 home page by saying, "http://www.wired.com/", which is not human-centered data. In
, fact, I need to make an effort to remember it at all. So, while the World Wide Web
 provides a retrieval mechanism to complement the existing storage mechanism, it leaves
 a lot to be desired, particularly for human beings.

 Finally, we move to "perceptualized" Internetworks, where the data has been sensualized,
 that is, rendered sensually. If something is represented sensually, it is possible to make
 sense of it. VRML is an attempt (how successful, only time and effort will tell) to place




       D
 humans at the center of the Internet, ordering its universe to our whims. In order to do
 that, the most important single element is a standard that defines the particularities of
 perception. Virtual Reality Modeling Language is that standard, designed to be a
 universal description language for multi-participant simulations.



     VE
 These three phases, storage, retrieval, and perceptualization are analogous to the human
 process of consciousness, as expressed in terms of semantics and cognitive science.
 Events occur and are recorded (memory); inferences are drawn from memory
 (associations), and from sets of related events, maps of the universe are created (cognitive
 perception). What is important to remember is that the map is not the territory, and we
 should avoid becoming trapped in any single representation or world-view. Although we
    O
 need to design to avoid disorientation, we should always push the envelope in the kinds
 of experience we can bring into manifestation!
   R

 This document is the living proof of the success of a process that was committed to being
 open and flexible, responsive to the needs of a growing Web community. Rather than re-
 invent the wheel, we have adapted an existing specification (Open Inventor) as the basis
 from which our own work can grow, saving years of design work and perhaps many
 PP


 mistakes. Now our real work can begin; that of rendering our noospheric space.

    History
 VRML was conceived in the spring of 1994 at the first annual World Wide Web
 Conference in Geneva, Switzerland. Tim Berners-Lee and Dave Raggett organized a
A




 Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) session to discuss Virtual Reality interfaces to the World Wide
 Web. Several BOF attendees described projects already underway to build three
 dimensional graphical visualization tools which interoperate with the Web. Attendees
 agreed on the need for these tools to have a common language for specifying 3D scene
 description and WWW hyperlinks -- an analog of HTML for virtual reality. The term
 Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) was coined, and the group resolved to begin
 specification work after the conference. The word ’Markup’was later changed to
 ’Modeling’to reflect the graphical nature of VRML.
, Shortly after the Geneva BOF session, the www-vrml mailing list was created to discuss
 the development of a specification for the first version of VRML. The response to the list
 invitation was overwhelming: within a week, there were over a thousand members. After
 an initial settling-in period, list moderator Mark Pesce of Labyrinth Group announced his
 intention to have a draft version of the specification ready by the WWW Fall 1994
 conference, a mere five months away. There was general agreement on the list that, while
 this schedule was aggressive, it was achievable provided that the requirements for the




       D
 first version were not too ambitious and that VRML could be adapted from an existing
 solution. The list quickly agreed upon a set of requirements for the first version, and
 began a search for technologies which could be adapted to fit the needs of VRML.




     VE
 The search for existing technologies turned up a several worthwhile candidates. After
 much deliberation the list came to a consensus: the Open Inventor ASCII File Format
 from Silicon Graphics, Inc. The Inventor File Format supports complete descriptions of
 3D scenes with polygonally rendered objects, lighting, materials, ambient properties and
 realism effects. A subset of the Inventor File Format, with extensions to support
 networking, forms the basis of VRML. Gavin Bell of Silicon Graphics has adapted the
 Inventor File Format for VRML, with design input from the mailing list. SGI has publicly
    O
 stated that the file format is available for use in the open market, and have contributed a
 file format parser into the public domain to bootstrap VRML viewer development.
